# CNN-Digit-Classification
After watching Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&t=435s) video I became curious about neural networks, I wanted to continue my exploration of deep learning via interactive learning. This project provided a simple way for me to learn how to write out simple neural network architectures in pytorch, while also giving me motivation to learn more about deep learning, specifically CNN's.

Before getting into any implementation, first I wanted to solidify my understanding of MLP's and also learn about the CNN architecture. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QKHHfPdCDTgCw6Ko_slAYBEqdBgACYAhIxXS-kMe8M8/edit?usp=sharing) are my notes on MLP's, and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1larZAdze_TzdZxS3wbQvTElkmNPsMFCemH9MevNQAuI/edit?usp=sharing) are my notes from learning how CNN's work. Now that I have a basic understanding of the theory behind the necessary architecture, let's get to implementing the model.
